The BibleGet project aims to facilitate consultation of Bible quotes and insertion into documents and web pages on various platforms,
by offering an API that can handle requests for Bible quotes,
and some client implementations that talk to the API to retrieve the Bible quotes for a single application.

Some of the client implementations that have been created so far:

* Microsoft Word add-on
* OpenOffice extension
* LibreOffice extension
* WordPress extension
